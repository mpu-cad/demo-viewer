            "With the help of a bevel gear, mechanical energy is transmitted from the gear to the wheel at an angle of 90 degrees. Due to the gear ratio on the wheel, the speed is much lower, but the high torque allows you to pull heavy loads.",
            "The low-speed shaft of the gearbox is connected to the end of the drum shaft by means of a coupling. It is capable of transmitting mechanical energy without changing the speed."
